# Avocado-Data-Analysis
avocado is a general photometric classification code that is designed to produce classifications of arbitrary astronomical transients and variable objects. This code is designed from the ground up to address the problem of biased spectroscopic samples. It does so by generating many lightcurves from each object in the original spectroscopic sample at a variety of redshifts and with many different observing conditions. The "augmented" samples of lightcurves that are generated are much more representative of the full datasets than the original spectroscopic samples.
